Hi, I am Shashank Sharma.
I do research about problem and build solutions for them.
Currently working as a Research Engineer at TCS Research, Kolkata; on the abstraction of different neuromorphic architectures for sensing and visual computing domains.

This website documents my projects, publications, research paper implementations, and some personal stuff.
