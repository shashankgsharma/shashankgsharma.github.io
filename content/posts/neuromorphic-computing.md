Neuromorphic computing is an approach to building intelligent systems inspired by the **structure and efficiency of the human brain**.

Traditional AI models run on hardware designed for arithmetic-heavy computation, such as GPUs. While these systems are powerful, they are often:

- energy intensive  
- latency heavy  
- not optimized for event-driven intelligence  

Neuromorphic computing takes a different route.

Instead of treating intelligence as continuous matrix multiplication, it models computation more like biological neurons:

- information is transmitted through **spikes**  
- neurons communicate only when necessary  
- computation becomes **event-driven**  

This makes neuromorphic systems especially promising for:

- low-power edge devices  
- real-time robotics  
- brain-inspired learning  
- next-generation AI hardware  

> “Neuromorphic computing is not just about faster AI — it is about building AI that computes the way nature does.”

A major building block in this field is the **Spiking Neural Network (SNN)**, where neurons fire discrete spikes rather than continuous activations.

As neuromorphic hardware and software frameworks mature, this area is becoming one of the most exciting frontiers in efficient and biologically inspired AI.

If you're curious about practical tools in this space, frameworks like **SNNTorch**, **Lava**, and **Rockpool** provide a great starting point.
