## Overview

This project focuses on generating **intent- and perspective-based summaries** using knowledge-augmented large language models.

The goal was to improve controllable summarization by integrating classifier guidance and energy-based objectives.

---

## Key Contributions

- Developed a pipeline for **perspective-based summarization** using:
  - classifier-guided loss  
  - energy-based loss functions  

- Implemented **parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)** techniques, including:
  - Prefix Tuning  
  - Adapter-based tuning  

- Experimented with **Flan-T5** and **LLaMA3** model families.

---

## Results

- Achieved a **BLEU score of 0.78** on intent-based summarization tasks.
