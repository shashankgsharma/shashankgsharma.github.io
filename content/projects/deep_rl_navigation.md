## Overview

This project involved re-implementing a deep reinforcement learning approach for **autonomous navigation over knowledge graphs**.

The agent learns paths through structured graph environments using policy gradient optimization.

---

## Key Contributions

- Re-implemented an RL-based navigation framework where:

  - Policy network uses an **LSTM** encoder  
  - Optimization is done via **REINFORCE**

- Evaluated performance on benchmark datasets for KG reasoning.

---

## Results

- Achieved **95.10 AUC-PR** on the **Countries-S3** dataset  
- Outperformed multiple baseline navigation methods
