## Overview

This project was developed as part of a collaboration between:

- MIDAS Labs, IIIT Delhi  
- TU Darmstadt, Germany  

The objective was to build real-time pipelines for **accident detection in streaming video**.

---

## Key Contributions

- Developed two accident detection approaches:

  1. **Object detection + tracking pipeline**
     - YOLO for detection  
     - DeepSORT for tracking  

  2. **Vision-language reasoning pipeline**
     - Used the **LLaVA-NeXT** multimodal model  

- Applied OpenCV-based preprocessing to optimize performance.

---

## Results

- Reduced latency by **8%** through pipeline optimizations.
